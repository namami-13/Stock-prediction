## Stock Market Predictor

### Introduction:
The Stock Market Predictor is a machine learning application that predicts future stock prices by analyzing recent data. It leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to forecast stock prices based on historical trends. The application is built using Python, Keras, and Streamlit, and fetches real-time stock data using the yfinance library.

### Features:
- __Real-time Stock Data:__ Fetches the most recent stock data for a specified stock symbol.

- __Data Preprocessing:__ Scales and prepares data for prediction using MinMaxScaler.

- __LSTM Model:__ Utilizes a pre-trained LSTM model to predict future stock prices.

- __Interactive Interface:__ Provides an intuitive and interactive interface using Streamlit.

- __Visualization:__ Displays original and predicted stock prices using Matplotlib.

### Installation:
1. __Clone The Repository:__
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-market-predictor.git
   cd stock-market-predictor

2. __Install Dependencies:__
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. __Run the application:__
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py

### Usage:
1. Enter the Stock Symbol
     - Open the application in your web browser.
     - Enter the stock symbol (e.g., GOOG) in the input field.
    
2. Fetch Data
     - The application will fetch the most recent stock data for the entered symbol.

3. View Predictions
     - The application will display the original stock prices and predict future prices for the next 30 days.
     - Visualize the data through interactive plots.
